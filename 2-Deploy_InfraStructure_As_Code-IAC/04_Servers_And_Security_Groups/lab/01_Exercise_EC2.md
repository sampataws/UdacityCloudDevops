##Research the EC2 Parameter Store
One way to avoid hard-coding ever-changing values into your server infrastructure is by using parameters. Examples of parameters that frequently change include database connection details, and sensitive data, such as passwords and secret API access keys.

Using the AWS CLI Tool, store and retrieve parameters from the EC2 Parameter Store. Play around with changing the value from the EC2 Console and not just the CLI Tool.

Itâ€™s critical that you practice this, as this is not only a best practice but also a common practice.
