* An Auto Scaling Group is in charge of providing servers for your application based on an Alarm/Criteria, such as number of concurrent users, CPU Usage or HTTP Requests
* Since The Auto Scaling Group is not specific to your application, you need to provide a Launch Configuration which says which machine image to use and how much memory and disk space your application will need, among other things.
* You can specify a Minimum and Maximum count of servers to use for Auto Scaling -- This is a great feature of cloud that can save you lots of money in unused infrastructure and itâ€™s a key example of the elasticity of the cloud.
