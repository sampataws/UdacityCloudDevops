##YAML and JSON
* YAML and JSON file formats are both supported in CloudFormation, but YAML is the industry preferred version that’s used for AWS and other cloud providers (Azure, Google Cloud Platform).

* An important note about YAML files: the whitespace indentation matters! We recommend that you use **four white spaces for each indentation**.

###Glossary in CloudFormation scripts
**Name**: A name you want to give to the resource (does this have to be unique across all resource types?)

**Type**: Specifies the actual hardware resource that you’re deploying.

**Properties**: Specifies configuration options for your resource. Think of these as all the drop-down menus and checkbox options that you would see in the AWS console if you were to request the resource manually.

**Stack**: A stack is a group of resources. These are the resources that you want to deploy, and that are specified in the YAML file.

###Best practices
**Coding best practice**: Create separate files to organize your code. You can either create separate files for similar resources or create files for each developer who uses those resources.

###Documentation for CloudFormation syntax
You don't need to memorize the code that you need for each resource. You can find sample code in the [documentation for CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) for examples of how to write your CloudFormation scripts.
