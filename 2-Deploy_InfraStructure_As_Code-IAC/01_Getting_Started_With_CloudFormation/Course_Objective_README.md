#Course Objectives
In this course, you will learn to provision cloud-infrastructure resources using (re-usable) scripts. We will use AWS as a cloud service provider. After completing the course, you will be able to:

1.Make use of the Cloud Formation tool to provision and manage cloud infrastructure. **Lesson 1: Introduction to Cloud Formation** presents the basics of this tool.
2.Create diagrams for web application architecture that represents how different resources can be placed in the cloud. **Lesson 2: Infrastructure Diagrams** will take the help of LucidChart to draw diagrams.
3.Provision networking components such as VPN, subnets, route tables, and internet gateway as a part of your cloud infrastructure. **Lesson 3: Networking Infrastructure** describes all the networking components mentioned above.
4.Deploy servers with the necessary level of security (firewall rules). **Lesson 4: Servers and Security Groups** demonstrate the placement of servers (VMs) in private subnets and managing them using a jump-box.
5.Attach the storage volumes to your servers. **Lesson 5: Storage and Databases** describes configuring the S3 service.

##Lesson Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to...

* Describe Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC) as one of the best practices used in the DevOps model.
* Configure basic settings to start using AWS services as an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user.
* Explain the fundamentals of Cloud Formation.
* Contrast the manual vs. automated (script-based) provisioning of Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
* Utilize the AWS command-line tool - CLI for necessary activities, such as configuring a VPC, or creating an IAM user.
