#Cloud Container
This represents your AWS account and all resources it can access.

#Region
A local business may be entirely contained in a region. So, if all your applications are always going to be deployed in the AWS Northern California region ( us-west-1 ) -for example- then you don’t need to specify this in your diagrams because all your co-workers will already know this.

The exception would be if you are designing a multi-region architecture, say, for Disaster Recovery reasons. In this case, it’s certainly useful to specify the region you are talking about, in your diagrams.
