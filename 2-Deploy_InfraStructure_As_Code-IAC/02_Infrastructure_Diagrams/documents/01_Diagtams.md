#Diagrams
Diagrams are a very important starting point for planning your cloud infrastructure. DevOps engineers start with a visual representation of the required cloud infrastructure before they turn it into code. This lesson will show you how to interpret these infrastructure diagrams.

##Lesson Objectives
In this lesson, you will learn to...

* Make use of www.lucidchart.com to draw the diagram.
* Identify the AWS resources that are required to be used in the diagram.
* Place the resources correctly in the diagram, such as VPC, availability zones, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway, autoscaling groups, load balancers, and EC2 instances.
