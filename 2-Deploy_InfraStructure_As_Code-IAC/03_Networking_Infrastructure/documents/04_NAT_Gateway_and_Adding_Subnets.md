##Adding Subnets
To specify a Subnet for your VPC you use the following syntax:
```yaml
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties: 
      AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation: Boolean
      AvailabilityZone: String
      CidrBlock: String
      Ipv6CidrBlock: String
      MapPublicIpOnLaunch: Boolean
      Tags: 
        - Tag
      VpcId: String
```

Here is the actual setup of our 2 private ```Subnets```:

```yaml
    PrivateSubnet1: 
        Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
        Properties:
            VpcId: !Ref VPC
            AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 0, !GetAZs '' ]
            CidrBlock: !Ref PrivateSubnet1CIDR
            MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false
            Tags: 
                - Key: Name 
                  Value: !Sub ${EnvironmentName} Private Subnet (AZ1)

    PrivateSubnet2: 
        Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
        Properties:
            VpcId: !Ref VPC
            AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 1, !GetAZs '' ]
            CidrBlock: !Ref PrivateSubnet2CIDR
            MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false
            Tags: 
                - Key: Name 
                  Value: !Sub ${EnvironmentName} Private Subnet (AZ2)
```

You can see the index being used from the returning ```AvailabilityZone```'s array. Notice that our ```subnets``` **are not** sharing ```AvailabilityZones```. We are keeping them separated like we displayed in our diagrams from the previous lesson:

PrivateSubnet1: ```AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 0, !GetAZ's '' ]```

PrivateSubnet2: ```AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 1, !GetAZ's '' ]```

This code:

```text
!select [0, !GetAZs‘’]
```
calls the function GetAZ, which returns a list of availability zones, which are indexed 0, 1 etc.

###Tip
* Name your subnets using tags, to keep track when you create many subnets.

##Adding a NAT Gateway
You can use ```NAT Gateways``` in both your public and/or private ```Subnets```. The following code is the basic syntax for declaring a ```NAT Gateway```:

```yaml
Type: AWS::EC2::NatGateway
Properties: 
  AllocationId: String
  SubnetId: String
  Tags: 
    - Tag
```


The following declarations are from the sample code shown in the above video:

```yaml
 NatGateway1EIP:
        Type: AWS::EC2::EIP
        DependsOn: InternetGatewayAttachment
        Properties: 
            Domain: vpc

    NatGateway2EIP:
        Type: AWS::EC2::EIP
        DependsOn: InternetGatewayAttachment
        Properties:
            Domain: vpc

    NatGateway1: 
        Type: AWS::EC2::NatGateway
        Properties: 
            AllocationId: !GetAtt NatGateway1EIP.AllocationId
            SubnetId: !Ref PublicSubnet1

    NatGateway2: 
        Type: AWS::EC2::NatGateway
        Properties:
            AllocationId: !GetAtt NatGateway2EIP.AllocationId
            SubnetId: !Ref PublicSubnet2
```



The ```EIP``` in ```AWS::EC2::EIP``` stands for Elastic IP. This will give us a known/constant IP address to use instead of a disposable or ever-changing IP address. This is important when you have applications that depend on a particular IP address. ```NatGateway1EIP``` uses this type for that very reason:

```yaml
 NatGateway1EIP:
        Type: AWS::EC2::EIP
        DependsOn: InternetGatewayAttachment
        Properties: 
            Domain: vpc
```

###Tip
* Use the ```DependsOn``` attribute to protect your dependencies from being created without the proper requirements.

In the scenario above the EIP allocation will only happen after the ```InternetGatewayAttachment``` has completed.
