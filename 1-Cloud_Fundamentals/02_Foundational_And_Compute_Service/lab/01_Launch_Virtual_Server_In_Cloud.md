#Virtual Servers in the Cloud
In this hands-on exercise, you will launch a virtual server in the cloud within a secure network. You will also manage additional storage options for your server.

##Prerequisites:
* AWS Account

##Topics Covered:
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Launch a secure EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instance within a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
* Manage an EBS volume

##Steps:
1. ####Access VPC service from AWS Management Console
    * On the AWS Management Console page, type ```vpc``` in the ```Find Services``` box and then select ```VPC```.
    * Click the ```Launch VPC Wizard``` button and select ```VPC with a Single Public Subnet```. Important: In the ```VPC Name``` text box, enter a name for the VPC, and then select the first AZ from the ```Availability Zone``` dropdown. Leave everything else as the defaults.
    * Select ```Create VPC button```.
    * You should see the ```VPC Successfully Created``` page, click the OK button in the far right. ```Important```: You should see a table that lists all of the VPCs, make a note of the one just created.
2. ####Launch an EC2 instance
    * Navigate to the EC2 console page, by clicking on ```Services``` in the upper left-hand menu. Type ```EC2``` in the text box and click on ```EC2``` found in the search results.
    * On the ```EC2``` Dashboard page, click on ```Instances``` in the left-hand navigation.
    * Click ```Launch Instance```.
    * Select the ```Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type``` Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Important: You are free to choose a different AMI, but to avoid excessive charges, pick one that says, ```Free Tier Eligible```.
    * For the ```Instance Type```, select the free-tier instance type of ```t2.micro```.
    * Click on ```Next: Configure Instance Details```.
    * Enter the 1 for the ```Number of Instances```.
    * For Purchasing option, leave unchecked.
    * For Network, select the VPC that was created in the previous step, and then select the subnet in to which to launch the instance.
    * Keep the other default settings on this page as is.
3. ####Attach an EBS volume
    * Click on ```Next: Add Storage``` to attach an EBS volume. ```Important:``` Here we already see there is a root volume (or device) attached to your instance, this is an EBS volume. We are going to add additional storage.
    * To attach additional storage, click on ```Add New Volume.```
    * Select ```Delete on Termination``` and keep the other default settings.
    * Click ```Review and Launch.```
    * Click ```Launch```
    * Generate and download a new key pair and then click ```Launch Instances.``` Important: This will allow you to SSH into your instance from your local machine. This is a one-time process, so generate and download the new key pair now.
    * The launch will take a couple of minutes, select ```View Instances``` during the wait.
    * Check the instance state, it should say running.

        ```Congratulations!``` You’ve launched your first virtual server in the cloud.
4. ####Cleanup & Disable EC2 Instance - To avoid recurring charges for leaving an instance running, let’s disable the EC2 instance and terminate the VPC
    * From the EC2 Dashboard, select the instance just created, click ```Actions```, then ```Instance State```, and then select ```Terminate```.
    * From the VPC Dashboard, select the VPC just created, click ```Actions```, then ```Delete VPC```.
