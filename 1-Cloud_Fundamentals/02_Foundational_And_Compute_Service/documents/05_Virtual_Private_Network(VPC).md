##Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Virtual Private Cloud or VPC allows you to create your own private network in the cloud. You can launch services, like EC2, inside of that private network. A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region.

VPC allows you to control your virtual networking environment, which includes:

* IP address ranges
* subnets
* route tables
* network gateways
##Tips
* VPC is found under Networking & Content Delivery section of the AWS Management Console.
* The default limit is 5 VPCs per Region. You can request an increase for these limits.
* Your AWS resources are automatically provisioned in a default VPC.
* There are no additional charges for creating and using the VPC.
* You can store data in Amazon S3 and restrict access so that itâ€™s only accessible from instances in your VPC.
