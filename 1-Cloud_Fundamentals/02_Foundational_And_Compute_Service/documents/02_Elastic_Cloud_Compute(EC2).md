##Elastic Cloud Compute
Elastic Cloud Compute or EC2 is a foundational piece of AWS' cloud computing platform and is a service that provides servers for rent in the cloud.

##Pricing Options
There are several pricing options for EC2.
* On Demand - Pay as you go, no contract.
* Dedicated Hosts - You have your own dedicated hardware and don't share it with others.
* Spot - You place a bid on an instance price. If there is extra capacity that falls below your bid, an EC2 instance is provisioned. If the price goes above your bid while the instance is running, the instance is terminated.
* Reserved Instances - You earn huge discounts if you pay up front and sign a 1-year or 3-year contract.

##Tips
* EC2 is found under the Compute section of the AWS Management Console.
* Spot instances can save you up to 90% off the on-demand pricing.
* There are several instance types that provide varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
