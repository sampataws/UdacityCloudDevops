#Lambda
AWS Lambda provides you with computing power in the cloud by allowing you to execute code without standing up or managing servers.
##Tips
* Lambda is found under the Compute section on the AWS Management Console.
* Lambdas have a time limit of 15 minutes.
* The code you run on AWS Lambda is called a “Lambda function.”
* Lambda code can be triggered by other AWS services.
* AWS Lambda supports Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#/.NET, Python, and Ruby. There is a Runtime API that allows you to use other programming languages to author your functions.
* Lambda code can be authored via the console.
