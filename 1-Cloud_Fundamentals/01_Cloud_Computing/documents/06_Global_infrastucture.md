##Region
A region is considered a geographic location or an area on a map.
##Availability Zone
An availability zone is an isolated location within a geographic region and is a physical data center within a specific region.
##Edge Location
An edge location is as a mini-data center used solely to cache large data files closer to a user's location.
##Additional Information
* There are more Availability Zones (AZs) than there are Regions.
* There should be at least two AZs per Region.
* Each region is located in a separate geographic area.
* AZs are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures.
