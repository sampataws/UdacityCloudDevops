Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the Internet that allows you to manage:
* Storage services likes databases
* Servers, compute power, networking
* Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
* Security services for data and applications


##Characteristics of Cloud Computing
* Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
* Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
* Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
