##Cloud Deployment Models

####Public Cloud
A public cloud makes resources available over the Internet to the general public.
####Private Cloud
A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people.
####Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud.
The hybrid model is a growing trend in the industry for those organizations that have been slow to adopt the cloud due to being in a heavily regulated industry. The hybrid model gives organizations the flexibility to slowly migrate to the cloud.
