#AWS Shield
AWS Shield is a managed DDoS (or Distributed Denial of Service) protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS.

AWS Shield is a service that you get "out of the box", it is always running (automatically) and is a part of the free standard tier. If you want to use some of the more advanced features, you'll have to utilize the paid tier.

#Tips
* AWS Shield can be found under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section on the AWS Management Console.
* AWS Shield Standard is always-on, using techniques to detect malicious traffic.
* AWS Shield Advanced provides enhanced detection.
