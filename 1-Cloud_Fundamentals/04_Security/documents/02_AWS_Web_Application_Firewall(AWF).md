#AWS WAF
AWS WAF (or AWS Web Application Firewall) provides a firewall that protects your web applications.

WAF can stop common web attacks by reviewing the data being sent to your application and stopping well-known attacks.

#Tips
* WAF is found under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section on the AWS Management Console.
* WAF can protect web sites not hosted in AWS through Cloud Front.
* You can configure CloudFront to present a custom error page when requests are blocked.
