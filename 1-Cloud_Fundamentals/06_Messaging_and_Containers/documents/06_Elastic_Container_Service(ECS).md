#Elastic Container Service (ECS)
ECS is an orchestration service used for automating deployment, scaling, and managing of your containerized applications. ECS works well with Docker containers by:

* launching and stopping Docker containers
* scaling your applications
* querying the state of your applications

#Tips
* ECS is under the Compute section on the AWS Management Console.
* You can schedule long-running applications, services, and batch processeses using ECS.
* Docker is the only container platform supported by Amazon ECS.
