#EC2 Auto Scaling
In this hands-on exercise, you will use Auto Scaling to automatically launch Amazon EC2 instances in response to conditions you specify. You will also see auto scaling in action as it automatically provisions a replacement instance.

##Prerequisites:
* AWS Account
##Topics Covered:
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Use auto scaling to launch EC2 instances
* Create an auto scaling group
* Test auto scaling
##Steps:
1. ###Create a Launch Configuration

    * On the AWS Management Console page, type ```EC2``` in the ```Find Services``` box and then select ```EC2```.
    * Scroll down to the ```Auto Scaling``` section on the left-hand menu and click ```Auto Scaling Groups```.
    * Click the ```Create Auto Scaling group``` button.
    * Review the steps and click on ```Get started```.
    * Create a launch configuration by first selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). In the row for ```Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type```, click the ```Select``` button.

    ```Note:``` An AMI is a template for an instance that indicates the operating system, an application server, and applications.
    * Confirm that ```t2.micro``` is selected.
    * Click ```Next: Configure details```.
    * Enter a name of your choosing in the ```Name``` field.
    * Expand the ```Advanced Details``` section.
    * Next to ```IP Address Type```, click on ```Assign a public IP address to every instance.```
    * Click ```Next: Add Storage```. Review the screen.
    * Click ```Next: Configure Security Group.```
    * Ensure ```Create a new security group``` is selected.
    * Click ```Review.```
    * Click on ```Create launch configuration.```
    * On the ```Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair```, select ```Create a new key pair```, enter a key pair name in the ```Key pair name``` field, and click ```Download Key Pair```.
    * Click on ```Create launch configuration```.

2. ###Create an Auto Scaling Group
    * On the ```Create Auto Scaling Group``` page, enter a group name of your choosing in the ```Group name``` field, ensure the ```Group size``` is set to ```1```, for ```Network``` leave the default value. If no default value is shown, click on ```Create new VPC```, and select the first ```Subnet``` by clicking in the ```Subnet``` field.
    * Click ```Next: Configure scaling policies```.
    * Ensure that ```Keep this group at its initial size is selected```.
    * Click ```Review```.
    * Review the selected options and click ```Create Auto Scaling group```.
    * Click ```Close```.

3. ###Verify your Auto Scaling Group
    * Verify that the group has launched your EC2 instance by first ensuring the auto scaling group you just created is selected and examining the ```Details``` tab shown on the bottom of the screen.
    * Click the ```Activity History``` tab. The status of your instance should be ```Successful```, which means the instance is launched.
    * Click on the ```Instances``` tab. Notice the ```Lifecycle``` column states ```InService```.

4. ###Test Auto Scaling
    * Click on the ```Instances``` tab.
    * Under the ```Instance ID``` column, click on the blue Instance ID link.
    * You will be taken to the Amazon EC2 console Instances page.
    * Your instance should be selected.
    * Click the ```Actions``` button, scroll down to ```Instance State```, and select ```Terminate```. Then select ```Yes, Terminate```.
    * In the left-hand navigation pane, click ```Auto Scaling Groups```.
    * Click the ```Instances``` tab. You will eventually see a new instance appear. If the new instance doesn’t appear, click refresh occasionally to update the list.
    * Click on the ```Activity History``` tab to review the history for the Instance.
5. ###Delete Auto Scaling Resources
    * At the top of the screen, click the``` Actions``` button next to the ```Create Auto Scaling group```.
    * Click the ```Delete``` option.
