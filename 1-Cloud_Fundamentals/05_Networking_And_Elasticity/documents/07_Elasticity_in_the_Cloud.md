##Elasticity in the Cloud
One of the main benefits of the cloud is that it allows you to stop guessing about capacity when you need to run your applications. Sometimes you buy too much or you don't buy enough to support the running of your applications.

With elasticity, your servers, databases, and application resources can automatically scale up or scale down based on load.
