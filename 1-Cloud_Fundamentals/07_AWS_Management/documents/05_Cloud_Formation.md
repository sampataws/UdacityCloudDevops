#Cloud Formation
AWS Cloud Formation allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file template allowing you to provision AWS resources based on the scripts you write.

##Tips
* Cloud Formation is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
* Cloud Formation templates are written using JSON or YAML.
* You can still individually manage AWS resources that are part of a CloudFormation stack.
