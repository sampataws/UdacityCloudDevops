#Logging In The Cloud
Logging provides visibility into your cloud resources and applications. For applications that run in the cloud, you will need access to logging and auditing services to help you proactively monitor your resources and applications.

Logging allows you to answer important questions like:

* How is this server performing?
* What is the current load on the server?
* What is the root cause of an application error that a user is seeing?
* What is the path that leads to this error?
