#Cloud Trail
Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.
#Features
CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including:

* who has logged in
* services that were accessed
* actions performed
* parameters for the actions
* responses returned
This includes actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.

#Tips
* Cloud Trail is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
* CloudTrail shows results for the last 90 days.
* You can create up to five trails in an AWS region.
