##DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a NoSQL document database service that is fully managed. Unlike traditional databases, NoSQL databases, are schema-less. Schema-less simply means that the database doesn't contain a fixed (or rigid) data structure.

##Tips
* DynamoDB is found under the Database section on the AWS Management Console.
* DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day.
* DynamoDB is serverless as there are no servers to provision, patch, or manage.
* DynamoDB supports key-value and document data models.
* DynamoDB synchronously replicates data across three AZs in an AWS Region.
* DynamoDB supports GET/PUT operations using a primary key.
