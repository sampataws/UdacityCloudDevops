    * On the left-hand side, click ```Databases```.
    * Click ```Create database```.
    * Under engines option, select ```MySQL``` and click the ```Next``` button
    * Under ```Instance specifications```, leave the defaults.
    * Under the ```Settings``` section:
        * Enter a name for the instance under ```DB instance identifier```
    **Note**: This will not be the database name.
    * Enter a ```Master username```
    * Enter a ```Master password``` and confirm the password.
    * Click ```Next```
    * For ```Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)```, select ```Create new VPC```.
    * Ensure ```Create new DB Subnet Group``` is selected.
    * Leave the defaults for ```Subnet group```, ```Public accessibility```, ```Availability zone```, and ```VPC security groups```.
    * Under ```Database options```, enter a ```Database name``` and leave the rest as defaults.
    * Under ```Deletion protection```, uncheck ```Enable deletion protection```. **Important**: In a real production scenario, you would leave this option checked.
    * Click Create database`.

2. ###View Instance Details
    * Once your database is created, open it by clicking on ```View DB Instance details```.
    * Make sure the ```DB instance status``` shows ```available```.
    * Scroll through and observe how the instance is configured.

3. ###Delete Database Instance Clean up the resources to avoid recurring charges.
    * From the RDS Dashboard homepage, select ```Databases``` from the left-hand navigation pane.
    * Select your newly created database by clicking on the name radio button next to the name.
